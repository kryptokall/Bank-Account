# bank-account üí∏üè¶
Simplistically simulates a bank account.

### Chronological explanation of the program:

The program allows the user to inform
- account number;
- agency number;
- account holder's full name.

Afterwards, the user is asked if they would like to enter a initial deposit - to which they shall repond with 'y' or 'n' - </br>
if the answer is yes, they can type a value to deposit into the account. </br>
if the answer is no, their account starts at $0.00 by default.

The account data is displayed, so the user can see the information they provided in more detail.

Then, the user is allowed to write a value to deposit. The value is added to the balance and the updated account details are shown. </br>
The user is then allowed to withdraw a quantity of their choice (being advised that there is a $5.0 fee applied to each withdrawal). </br>
The amount is deducted and again the updated data is shown.

This is basically how the program works :) .
